# CrosswordsHelper_GUI
### An interesting story
> Kennard is playful boy who is very interested in crosswords ( a kind of puzzle, as following )

> ![puzzle](https://kennardwang.github.io/ImageSource/Project/CrosswordsPuzzle.png)

> Kennard is not an expert in English, so that sometimes he has no idea about the words of the puzzle.  
> Now, can you try to write a useful software to help him finish the crosswords ?

### Demo

![demo](https://kennardwang.github.io/ImageSource/Project/CrosswordsDemo.png)

+ For example, we define **pattern** as a term consists of character and number

  > **u,3** denotes that the character **u** is on **third** index of the word  
  > Kennard can use foregoing pattern groups if he wants to search a word whose **third** index is **u**, **fourth** index is **a**  
  > He can also select **Top-N** rank words ( highest appearance rate ) to display, here **N=15**
